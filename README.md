Apart from that I also love to guide and mentor newbies 👨🏻‍💻. I like to use a variety of useful computer software & making scripts in bash to automate processes. I also like watching anime, and gaming. I used to dream of being a gamer. But the reality made me have to learn a technology and I also came into contact with Hacking 💻.
