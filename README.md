**I’m a 24-year-old Security Researcher & Bug Bounty Hunter** with a strong passion for learning, exploring, and building. I’m deeply enthusiastic about **cybersecurity** and love diving into new technologies, breaking things to understand how they work, and securing them again 🔧🛡️.

I enjoy working across different domains — from **automation** ⚙️ to **web technologies** 🌐 — and I’m always driven by **curiosity** and **real-life problem solving** 💡. I frequently create **Bash scripts** 📝 and **custom tools** 🛠️ to automate tasks and boost productivity 🚀.

Alongside my own journey, I genuinely enjoy **helping and mentoring beginners** 👨🏻‍💻 who are stepping into the world of cybersecurity.

Outside of tech, I’m into anime, gaming, and everything that sparks creativity. I once dreamed of becoming a gamer, but life introduced me to the world of hacking — something I wasn’t interested in at first, but eventually grew to love deeply. Now, cybersecurity isn’t just a skill for me; it’s a passion I continue to nurture every day :heart:.
